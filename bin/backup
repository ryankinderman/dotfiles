#!/bin/bash -e
#
# Perform incremental backups using rsync and hard links.
#
# Usage:
#
#   $ sh backup.sh SOURCE=... BACKUP_HOST=... BACKUP_PATH=...
#
# Description:
#
#   The script will take an initial full backup of the SOURCE and store it in
#   the BACKUP_PATH directory on the BACKUP_HOST machine. This will create a
#   timestamp directory in BACKUP_PATH with format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS that
#   contains the SOURCE backup copy. A symlink named 'current' will also be
#   created in BACKUP_PATH which will point to the timestamp directory.
#   Subsequent backups will create a new timestamp directory and copy only
#   the files that have changed from what is currently in the directory
#   pointed to by 'current'; all other files will be hard-linked in the new
#   timestamp directory from 'current'. Lastly, the 'current' symlink will
#   be updated to point to the latest timestamp directory.
#
#   Note: This script uses rsync and ssh, and public/private keys must be
#   configured between the SOURCE machine and the BACKUP_HOST machine for
#   passwordless authentication.
#
# Parameters:
#
#   SOURCE    The source path to back up
#   BACKUP_HOST
#             The hostname or IP of the remote host to back up on
#   BACKUP_PATH
#             The path on BACKUP_HOST to store the backups
#
# Example:
#
#   Back up the /home/ryan directory on this machine to /mnt/backupdrive on the
#   backupserver machine.
#
#   $ sh backup.sh SOURCE=/home/ryan BACKUP_HOST=backupserver BACKUP_PATH=/mnt/backupdrive
#
#   Note that this will create a directory named 'ryan' in /mnt/backupdrive on
#   backupserver that mirrors the 'ryan' directory on this machine.

#################################################
# Check that expected backup host is available
#################################################
#
# Since this script could be run automatically via a cron job, and because it could be run
# on a host that changes networks frequently (like a laptop), it's important to have a way
# to ensure that we're talking to the right backup host before actually attempting a
# backup, to prevent hijacking attempts. To that end, this script can run in an (unsafe)
# "configuration" mode if the CONFIGURE variable is set to true. This causes the script to
# retrieve and cache information about the backup host for later use in verifying that
# it's safe to attempt a backup to the host. When not running in "configuration" mode,
# the script requires that the cached information about the backup host is already
# available; if it's not, the script will exit with an error. When not running in
# "configuration" mode, before performing a backup, the script will do the following:
#
# 1. Ping the backup host to see if it's available.
# 2. Compare the MAC address of the backup host with the configured MAC address. If the
#    MAC addresses match, the script continues; otherwise, the script stops. No errors are
#    produced, since this is an frequently-expected occurrence with a laptop.
# 3. (TODO for extra security) SSH into the backup host and compare a key shared between
#    the backup and source hosts. If the two keys don't match, the script aborts and
#    reports an error.
