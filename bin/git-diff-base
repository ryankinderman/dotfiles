# Little helper script to reduce typing when trying to see the changes on a
# checked-out branch as compared with the mainline dev branch.  Often times,
# the mainline branch has additional commits, and those will show up in the
# diff, but all I want to see are the changes in the checked-out branch
# relative to where it started diverging from the mainline branch.  This does
# that.
#
# Maybe there's a pre-existing command to do this, but I'm unaware of it.
