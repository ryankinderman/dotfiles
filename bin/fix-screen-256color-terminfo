# This script updates the "screen-256color" terminfo db so that the "standout
# mode" is set to use reverse video. If the command isn't run w/sudo, it will
# write its output to the $HOME/.terminfo directory; if run with sudo, it will
# write to /etc/terminfo (see tic(1) manpage for more details).
#
# Background:
#
# Occasionally, the ncurses-base package is updated, which could change
# /lib/terminfo/s/screen-256color, the terminfo database that tmux uses.  When
# this has happened in the past on Ubuntu, the "standout mode" changes to use
# the hard-to-see italics display form.  The "standout mode" terminal
# capability is used for highlighting text when, for example, you search for
# something in "less".  My preferred effect for standout is reverse video
# instead of italics.  I'm not sure, but I think reverse video is the typical
# effect in other terminfo dbs as well.
